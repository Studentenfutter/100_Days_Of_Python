# Day 02 - Tip Calculator

# Notes
- Counting in Python starts from 0
- Integers can be separated by _ for better visibilty and will be ignored by python
- Types can be converted into other types
  - To a string: str()
  - To a flaot: float()
  - To an int: int()
## Mathematical operations
- When dividing, the result **always** is a float - workaround: // returns an integer
- \*\* is equal to raising a number (exponent)
- Priority for Mathematical Operations: PEMDAS
  - (Parentheses)
  - Exponents \*\*
  - Multiplication \*
  - Division /
  - Addition +
  - Subtraction -
- Mathematical operators can also be combined with assign operator
  - Instead of `score = score + 1` use `score += 1`

# Mix strings with different data types
- Use ftypes `print(f"your score is {score}")`
